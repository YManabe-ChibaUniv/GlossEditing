# GlossEditing

# About
This application controls gloss perception by detecting gloss in an image and highlighting or suppressing glossy areas.

# How to use
1. Put the image files in the img directory. (Note: Currently, only BMP format is supported.)
2. Edit all images in the img directory at once by running "./gestart".
   Use the option "-p" to edit the image with an arbitrary scale factor.
   The scale factor is specified as an arbitrary integer. A positive value emphasizes gloss, a negative value suppresses gloss.
